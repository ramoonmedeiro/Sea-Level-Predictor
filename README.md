# Sea-Level-Predictor


In this project it was not necessary to perform data cleaning. The idea was to make predictions using the dataset data (epa-sea-level.csv).

For the first case, data from the years between 1880 and 2013 were used to perform the linear regression using scipy. The line that represents the first regression expanding the values up to 2050 can be seen in the image below, in blue color.

The second regression was performed using only values between 2000 and 2013, expanding to 2050. A straight line was obtained again, which can also be seen in the image below, it is the orange colored line.
