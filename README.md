# Sea-Level-Predictor

The idea of this project is to estimate the sea level in the year 2050 with data (epa-sea-level.csv) from 1880 to 2013 using linear regression with scipy.

For the first case, data from the years between 1880 and 2013 were used to perform the linear regression. The line that represents the first regression expanding the values up to 2050 can be seen in the image below, in blue color.

The second regression was performed using only values between 2000 and 2013, expanding to 2050. A straight line was obtained again, which can also be seen in the image below, it is the orange colored line.

The two lines have different slopes because from 2000 onwards sea level values have increased more compared to previous years.
